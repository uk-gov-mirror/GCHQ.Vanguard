        :class:`gpytorch.distributions.MultivariateNormal` or
        :class:`gpytorch.distributions.MultitaskMultivariateNormal`. Otherwise, adds a rank ``rank``
        covariance matrix to it.

        :math:`I_{n}`, an identity matrix with size equal to the data and a (not necessarily diagonal) matrix
        containing the task noises :math:`D_{t}`.

        We also incorporate a shared ``noise`` parameter from the base
        :class:`gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood` that we extend.

        There is also the fixed noise (supplied to
        :meth:`~vanguard.multitask.likelihoods.FixedNoiseMultitaskGaussianLikelihood.__init__`
        as ``noise``) represented as :math:`\sigma^*` of length :math:`nt` with task-contiguous blocks.
